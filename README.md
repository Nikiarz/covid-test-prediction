# Predicting COVID-19 Test Outcomes

During my time at Universal Diagnostic Lab, I worked on building a pipeline to predict COVID-19 test results based on patient data and metadata. This project showcases how we can clean medical data, perform exploratory analysis, and train predictive models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training with Random Forest
- Evaluation of accuracy and classification report

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook, Seaborn

## Dataset
A simulated dataset with patient metadata, symptoms, and COVID-19 test results.
